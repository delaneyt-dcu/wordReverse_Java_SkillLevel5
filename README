# wordReverse_Java_SkillLevel5
Program that prompts user for a word and then calls a recursive method to spell it in reverse


This program is an answer to a continous assessment paper Question 2 of Assignment 3 for JAVA as follows:


Write a program that prompts the user to enter a word and then calls a recursive method 

public static String reverse(String str)


that computes the reverse of the word entered.

 For example, if the user enters the word “NOEL” the program will display the word “LEON”.



Hint:
Reverse the substring starting at the second character, then add the first character at the end.
